## cards
### [The other side up](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/cards)

Double-sided informal visiting card(s).

## optimise
### [From > 1 Billion years to < 1 second](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/optimise)

Presentation on the topic of code optimisation given at PyCon Sweden. Learn 10+ techniques applicable in a wide variety of situations and see how Python performance compares to C++.

## prisoner
### [Prisoner's behaviour, an economic dilemma](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/prisoner)

This presentation defines the classic "prisoner's dilemma" payoff matrix and explains enough game theory concepts to go through multiple reasonable strategies. It points out the conceptual differences for infinitely iterated PD and how this affects outcomes and tactics. Near the end, a special mention is made about superrational players.

## pycrastinate
### [TODO less, DO more](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/pycrastinate)

Presentation given at PyCon Sweden 2014 about a language-agnostic tool to handle TODOs. Its purpose is to list, process, filter, sort and report TODOs from repositories. E.g. automatically create and send a report of >60 days old FIXMEs by git commiter for critical repositories on branch master, so one may act on them.

## rhythm
### [Patterns beyond time and sound: visualising rhythm](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/rhythm)

This presentation explores the elements that define rhythm (i.e. relative/absolute duration, pace, speed, etc.) and how they may be represented, starting from it's origins in the western musical notation tradition.

It continues from written symbols which describe rhythms to media that are actual representations of physical events and can reproduce sounds with great consistency and precision (e.g. metronomes, piano rolls, barrel organs, etc.).

Finally, it concludes showcasing [a novel real-time rhythm representation](https://github.com/isaacbernat/rhythm-radar). A system based on polar coordinates projected to a screen, taking full advantage of a versatility that a static sheet or disc simply can't offer.

## self
### [Note from self](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/self)

Short and informal self-introduction I gave as a new recruit at Preply in April 2020.

## tinymem
### [Tinymem: a game under 40 lines and under 30mm](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/tinymem)

Lightning talk given at PyDayBCN about a game with menus, audio, sprites, text, button inputs... programmed in under 40 MicroPython lines.
The game runs in Thumby, a Raspberry Pi Pico based console which is less than 30mm in it's widest dimension.
