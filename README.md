## optimise
### From > 1 Billion years to < 1 second

Adding resources to speed up processes isn't always feasible. This talk presents a simple problem and how to achieve >10^15x speedups on a regular laptop. Be warned, as overall time is reduced, minuscule overheads become gigantic. Nevertheless, most techniques can still be effective in more general contexts.

## prisoner
### Prisoner's behaviour, an economic dilemma

This presentation defines the classic "prisoner's dilemma" payoff matrix and explains enough game theory concepts to go through multiple reasonable strategies. It points out the conceptual differences for infinitely iterated PD and how this affects outcomes and tactics. Near the end, a special mention is made for superrational players.

## rhythm
### Patterns beyond time and sound: visualising rhythm

This presentation explores the elements that define rhythm (i.e. relative/absolute duration, pace, speed, etc.) and how they may be represented, starting from it's origins in the western musical notation tradition.

It continues from written symbols which describe rhythms to media that are actual representations of physical events and can reproduce sounds with great consistency and precision (e.g. metronomes, piano rolls, barrel organs, etc.).

Finally, it concludes showcasing a novel real-time rhythm representation. A system based on polar coordinates projected to a screen, taking full advantage of a versatility that a static sheet or disc simply can't offer.
