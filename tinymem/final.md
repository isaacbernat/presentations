- Welcome to the last talk of PyDayBCN2023
	- I work at Preply, one of the sponsors
	- An EdTech startup. It's not about food delivery, but I guess you'd be tired after a whole day of workshops so I thought that would get your attention
	- It was founded in 2012 Kyiv
	- Opened offices in Barcelona in 2019
	- Since then, we opened offices in NYC and got $165M more in funding
	- We are hiring, well-funded and a cool place to work. 
	- Check the link for more info, our booth or talk to me later.
- In this repo you'll find all the info related to today's talk
