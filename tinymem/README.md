# Tinymem: a game under 40 lines and under 30mm

Lightning talk given at [PyDayBCN](https://pybcn.org/events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2023/) about a game with menus, audio, sprites, text, button inputs... programmed in under 40 MicroPython lines.
The game runs in [Thumby](https://thumby.us/), a Raspberry Pi Pico based console which is less than 30mm in its largest dimension.

For further resources and/or contributions, the game has its own repository: [github.com/isaacbernat/tinymem](https://github.com/isaacbernat/tinymem)
