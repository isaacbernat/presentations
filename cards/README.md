#### 0-3 Screen
##### 0 Frame:
Original plastic colour from a 15" SVGA (my first monitor).
##### 1 Margin:
Space between the projected screen image and the border of the frame. The margin in the picture was further darkened (not only 100% black, but also other colours on CMYK). This is so the printed card better represents the real contrast with the neighbouring sections.
##### 2 Curvature:
The glass on the front panel of the CRT screen is curved, not flat. It's clearly seen when compared to the lower plastic frame variable width (thicker on the corner (near 0) than middle section (near 5)).
##### 3 Reflection:
`IsaacBernat` text is reflected on the plastic. This is despite the material, angle... are not optimised for that purpose.

#### 4-6 Pathname
##### 4 Repository:
This is how git repositories are represented in my zsh terminal. `RepositoryName git:(BranchName)`. That path is printed on each line, to indicate the user's location within the file system.
##### 5 Brightness:
The image was postprocessed so that `IsaacBernat` colour was white. This increases the perceived brightness on print. I wanted no ink to be used on paper, so the natural background colour would apparently be shinier. The effect is subtle. It highlights the most important part on a card (which is the name/contact information) while remaining not too obvious. The path appears twice to reinforce the message.
##### 6 Branch:
The default `master` branch name is used here. Also as a pun, implying that Isaac's skill level on "git" is that of mastery ^_^ .

### Technical details
- The printed resolution is 300 dpi.
- The size 86x55mm doesn't correspond to the physical card. It includes "safety margins" required by the printer.
