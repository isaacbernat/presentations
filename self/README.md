## Additional notes
### Intro of and intro
- Inspired by [Harald Geisler's postcards](https://haraldgeisler.com/2014/05/16/postcards/)

### Background: coding
- Here is my first computer: an [80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) (already ancient when I took the picture). It spurred my interest in bytes and pixels.
- I started coding at ~15 with with simple macros to automate tasks for the game [Ultime Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online).
- Obtained my Computer Engineering degree in [Barcelona School of Informatics (UPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_School_of_Informatics)
- Did my Master Thesis at [NTNU (Norway's Technical University)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology).
- I contribute to Open Source, and [my most popular repo](https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt) is little more than a regex, but people use it :D.

### Background: Python
- My professional Python experience comes mostly from working in 2 Stockholm startups (2012-2016 and 2018-2020).
- My experience presenting Python-related topics comes mainly from Sweden too. You may check [the latest one in PyCon Sweden YouTube channel on optimisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asZ0SDTKqvM) or [its companion repository: From >1 Billion years to <1 second](https://github.com/isaacbernat/presentations/tree/master/optimise)
- Other places I worked at haven't been focussed on Python. [Check my resume for that](https://github.com/isaacbernat/cv) or [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacbernat/) to know more.

### Hobbies: games
- [Lan Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party): From time to time I like to organise a small one like the one pictured. You can tell it's "modern" because everyone is on a laptop and there are no CRT screens. But many of our games of choice are still from the 20th century (e.g. [Quake3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena)).
- Boardgames and RPGs: when I was a student I joined a boardgaming association where I became VP and treasurer for 4 years. I especially liked european-style games and narrative-focused RPGs.

### Hobbies: piano
I started to learn piano playing almost 2 years ago. These pictures are from my times in Stockholm.
- **Top left**: New York Steinway model C from 1896 at Hallwylska museum (with custom casing).
- **Top right**: NystrÃ¶m piano designed by Sigurd Lewerentz in the 1930s at Nationalmuseum
- **Bottom left**: Wittmayer revival harpsichord from 1968. Sold to return to Barcelona. Glenn Gould's favourite brand.
- **Bottom right**: Kawai VPC1. The digital piano controller I still use nowadays via USB.
