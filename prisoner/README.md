# Prisoner's behaviour, an economic dilemma
This presentation defines the classic "prisoner's dilemma" payoff matrix and explains enough game theory concepts to go through multiple reasonable strategies. It points out the conceptual differences for infinitely iterated PD and how this affects outcomes and tactics. Near the end, a special mention is made for superrational players.

## Survey results
If you were not during the presentation and want to contribute, you may fill this survey. Please, don't cheat and answer the questions as they are presented on the slides. [Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AJ6Bk7S_8F4-Dco6-AWgMVS5s7kgQ0IT-VnYhUQtKvo/edit).

I had such a great audience :D! I got 12 responses from the public, more than I expected! (Even if many have missing fields).
You may [find them here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ylxYlNx40GHQhrzJtuCVKZPco-h94ivhUgvlFFI9pao/edit#gid=0) . On the second sheet there is a short explanation on why I added that question, and what I intended to demonstrate or refute (I acknowledge the questionnaire design wouldn't resist serious scrutiny, and the sample is very small, but it's mainly just for fun, OK?).

- Overall the feedback was very positive (avg 8.2/10), but more overly so for people who said that they knew little or nothing about PD at the beginning (avg 9.1/10) the big majority). I think this reinforces the idea that it was good to introduce the topic on PD slowly and not go into mathematical proofs.
- **Spoiler alert!** Even people who said they were familiar with PD had very strong opinions on Q2 and Q3 that proved to be wrong. I am very happy, because it means I taught them too a valuable lesson :)
- **Spoiler alert!** People were totally consistent between questions 4-6. I expected some to change their minds. This might mean that it was already quite clear the presentation as explained in the first case.
- **Spoiler alert!** Everybody who claimed prior knowledge to PD (above or equal to 2/10) chose defect while those who claimed no knowledge at all (1/10 or less) chose cooperate. I think this nicely illustrates the point on slide 2.3 (PD on real people). Hopefully after being presented with conclusions (3.1) people will be more friendly with strangers and make a better and more cohesive society.
